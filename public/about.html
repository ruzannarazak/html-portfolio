<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a a self-professed crazy cat lady who yearns to retire early to live on a desserted cat island in a tiny house that i built.</p>

<p>My job is to manage tech talent in the public sector. To be good at my job, i need to build up my technical skills. Hence I am here learning to code to build a web app.</p>

<p>I am taking three times as long as I should to go through this web course. If you are seeing this, I have completed 1/3 of the web course. Wheeeeee!</p>
